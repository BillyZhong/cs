# Linked List
* A *linked list* is a collection of nodes where each node has a value and a reference
* **Singly-linked list**: nodes have pointers to the next node
* **Doubly-linked list**: nodes have pointers to next and previous nodes
* Time complexity:
  * Access by index: `O(n)`
  * Search by value: `O(n)`
  * Insert: `O(1)`
  * Delete: `O(1)`
